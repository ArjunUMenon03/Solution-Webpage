# Module-4 Solution Webpage

## Overview

This project is a simple HTML page designed to demonstrate the solution for Module-4 of the course/tutorial. It incorporates an external JavaScript file (`script.js`) that runs in the background and outputs relevant information to the browser’s developer console.
